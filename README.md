# Advanced R Programming – Term Project

This project was completed as part of the **Advanced R Programming** course.
It demonstrates the application of **advanced R techniques** for data
manipulation, analysis, and visualization, with an emphasis on clean,
reproducible, and well-structured code.

---

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Apply advanced R programming concepts to a real dataset
- Perform data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- Produce meaningful statistical summaries and visualizations
- Write modular, readable, and reproducible R code

---

## Data & Analysis
The project works with structured data and includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Handling missing or inconsistent values
- Transformation and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical summaries and visual inspection of key variables

---

## Methodology
Key techniques used in this project include:
- Functional programming concepts in R
- Efficient data manipulation
- Use of advanced R libraries
- Structured workflow from raw data to insights
- Clear separation of data preparation, analysis, and visualization steps

---

## Visualizations
The project includes multiple plots to:
- Explore variable distributions
- Compare groups or trends
- Support analytical conclusions with visual evidence

All visualizations are created following good data visualization principles.
